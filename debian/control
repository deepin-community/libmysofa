Description: library to read HRTFs stored in the AES69-2015 SOFA format - development files
 libmysofa is a light weight C-library intended to read SOFA (Spatially Oriented
 Format for Acoustics) files for spatial rendering.
 It hardly has any library dependencies and is suitable for embedded devices.
 .
 It reads SOFA files and checks whether the data complies to the
 "SimpleFreeFieldHRIR" conventions. In addition, it provides functions to
 look-up and interpolate the filters for a given orientation and to normalize
 the HRTFs (Head-Related Transfer Functions) to a reference level.
 .
 This package contains the files necessary to compile applications using
 libmysofa.
